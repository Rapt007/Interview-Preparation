# Concepts and Different Problems that can be solved

1. Linear Search - (Best Case O(1), Worst Case O(N) )
   - Finding whether an element exists in an array. 
   - whether an element exists within the range of index.
   - Finding the min and max element within an array.

2. Binary Search - (Best Case O(1), Worst Case O(log N) )
   - Finding whether an element exist in a sorted array.
   - Ceiling of a number (Smallest Number in an array greater than or equal to Target)
   - Floor of a number (Biggest number in an array smaller than or equal to Target Ex- arr = [2,3,4,6,8], Target = 5 , Floor = 4 and Ceiling = 6)
